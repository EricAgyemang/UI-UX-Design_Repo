# User Interface/User Experience Design (UI/UX-Design); ISU-IT467

# Human Factors In Information Systems.

# Description: 

This course provides students with an overview of human factors issues in developing a user interface. 
The production of a high-quality interface requires the developers to match the human/computer interface of information systems
to the target audience or users. Students will gain an understanding of why a system is easy or difficult to use by studying relevant concepts
related to the human experience, analyzing data, and applying this information with a hands-on design involving a prototyping and development 
process to create systems that people can and will want to use.

# Objectives:

  ** Upon successful completion of the course, you should:
    • Understand the importance of human factors design in developing and designing information systems.
    
    • Be able to evaluate an existing system with respect to its human/computer interface and its user aids or support materials.
    
    • Be able to apply human factor design criteria during system development to improve user/system performance.
    
    • Understand the psychological principles which are relevant to human factor design.
    
    • Be able to develop an appropriate human/computer interface and user aids or support materials for a proposed information system.
    
    • Be able to develop a new system that incorporates human factor design elements.
